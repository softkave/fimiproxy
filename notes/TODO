# fimiproxy

## Now

- correlated log by req + res, keep socket and start buffer on start request for correlation
- multi-instance
- runtime config changes
- cannot send headers after they are sent bug

## Later

- address TODOs in code
- no downtime config changes
- use multiple threads
- benchmarks
- make into class so we can have multiple fimiproxy instances
- prefer https over http when there's both origin servers
- proper error handling
- return artifacts from start calls so callers can perform explicit graceful shutdowns
- add validation checks to config file, and config
- prevent multiple start calls until transition to class-based encapsulation
- use http-graceful-shutdown for graceful shutdown implementation
- what to do about CONNECT calls
- better and encompassing error logging, usage logging, and metrics logging
- allow loading JS scripts for dynamic routing
